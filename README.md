- **Webview Control Panel**: Interactive interface for managing all CodeForge operations
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Live progress monitoring and status reporting
- **Intuitive Workflow Controls**: Streamlined access to fuzzing and analysis tools

## Getting Started

### Activity Bar Interface

CodeForge adds a custom activity bar icon (hammer) to VSCode that provides access to the main control panel. Click the CodeForge icon in the activity bar to open the interactive webview interface where you can:

- Start fuzzing operations
- Monitor active containers
- Access crash analysis tools
- Manage Docker environments
- View real-time status updates

### Command Palette Access

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and type "CodeForge" to see all available commands.

## Usage

### Quick Start: Fuzzing Workflow

1. **Initialize CodeForge**: Use `CodeForge: Initialize CodeForge` to set up your workspace
2. **Open Control Panel**: Click the CodeForge hammer icon in the activity bar
3. **Configure Fuzzing**: Use the webview interface to configure your fuzzing targets
4. **Start Fuzzing**: Launch fuzzing operations directly from the control panel
5. **Analyze Results**: View crash reports and analyze results using the integrated tools

### Quick Start: Register a Task

The fastest way to get started with CodeForge tasks is to use the **`CodeForge: Register Task`** command:

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type `CodeForge: Register Task` and press Enter
3. Enter your command (e.g., `npm test`, `python app.py`, `make build`)
4. That's it! Your task is automatically registered and ready to use

The command automatically:

- Creates a properly formatted task with label `Run in CodeForge: [command]`
- Adds a description `Run '[command]' in CodeForge container`
- Saves it to `.vscode/tasks.json`
- Offers to run the task immediately

You can customize the generated task later by editing `.vscode/tasks.json` if needed.

### Available Commands

#### Core Commands

1. `CodeForge: Initialize CodeForge` - Initialize CodeForge in your current workspace
2. `CodeForge: Build Docker Environment` - Build the Docker environment based on your configuration
3. `CodeForge: Launch Terminal in Container` - Open an interactive terminal in a Docker container
4. `CodeForge: Run Command in Container` - Run a specific command inside a Docker container
5. `CodeForge: Register Task` - **Recommended:** Quickly register a new CodeForge task

#### Fuzzing Commands

6. `CodeForge: Run Fuzzing Tests` - Start fuzzing operations with configured targets
7. `CodeForge: List Active Containers` - View all currently running containers
8. `CodeForge: Terminate All Containers` - Stop all running CodeForge containers
9. `CodeForge: Cleanup Orphaned Containers` - Clean up orphaned or stale containers

### Fuzzing Operations

CodeForge provides comprehensive fuzzing capabilities through its integrated framework:

#### CMake Integration

CodeForge automatically discovers CMake presets configured for fuzzing:

```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "configurePresets": [
    {
      "name": "fuzzing",
      "displayName": "Fuzzing Build",
      "description": "Build configuration for fuzzing targets"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Fuzzing Workflow

1. **Target Discovery**: Automatic detection of fuzz targets in your project
2. **Build Process**: Cross-platform compilation of fuzzing targets
3. **Execution**: Configurable fuzzing runs with real-time monitoring
4. **Crash Detection**: Automatic discovery and cataloging of crashes
5. **Analysis**: Integrated crash analysis with GDB debugging support

### Crash Analysis

When crashes are detected, CodeForge provides comprehensive analysis tools:

#### Crash Discovery

- Automatic monitoring of fuzzing output directories
- Real-time crash detection and cataloging
- Crash file organization and management

#### Crash Investigation

- Detailed crash information display
- Integrated hex viewer for examining crash dumps
- GDB integration for deep crash analysis
- Symbol resolution and stack trace analysis

### Task Provider

CodeForge includes a VSCode Task Provider that allows you to run commands inside Docker containers. This integrates seamlessly with VSCode's task system.

#### Quick Task Registration (Recommended)

The easiest way to create CodeForge tasks is using the **`CodeForge: Register Task`** command:

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run `CodeForge: Register Task`
3. Enter the command you want to run in the container (e.g., `npm test`, `make build`)
4. The task is automatically created with:
   - Label: `Run in CodeForge: [your command]`
   - Description: `Run '[your command]' in CodeForge container`
5. You'll be prompted to run the task immediately or can run it later via `Terminal â†’ Run Task`

This command automatically creates or updates your `.vscode/tasks.json` file with the proper configuration. You can later edit `tasks.json` manually if you want to customize the labels, descriptions, or add additional properties like port mappings.

#### Manual Task Configuration

While using `CodeForge: Register Task` is recommended, you can also manually create or edit tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "codeforge",
      "label": "Run in CodeForge: Build",
      "command": "make build", // REQUIRED: Command to execute
      "detail": "Builds the project in Docker container",
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "codeforge",
      "label": "Run in CodeForge: Test",
      "command": "npm test", // REQUIRED: Command to execute
      "detail": "Runs tests in Docker container",
      "group": {
        "kind": "test",
        "isDefault": true
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "codeforge",
      "label": "Run in CodeForge: Dev Server",
      "command": "npm run dev", // REQUIRED: Command to execute
      "detail": "Starts development server in Docker container"
    },
    {
      "type": "codeforge",
      "label": "Run in CodeForge: Web Server with Port Forwarding",
      "command": "python -m http.server 8080", // REQUIRED: Command to execute
      "detail": "Starts a web server with port forwarding",
      "ports": ["8080:8080"] // Forward container port 8080 to host port 8080
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** The `"command"` property is required for all tasks. Without it, the task will fail. For quick task creation, use the `CodeForge: Register Task` command instead of manually editing this file.

### Port Forwarding

CodeForge supports automatic port forwarding from Docker containers to your host machine. This is essential for accessing services running inside containers, such as web servers, databases, or development servers.

#### Task-Specific Port Configuration

You can specify port mappings for individual tasks using the `"ports"` property:

```json
{
  "type": "codeforge",
  "label": "Run Development Server",
  "command": "npm run dev",
  "ports": [
    "3000:3000", // Forward container port 3000 to host port 3000
    "9229:9229" // Forward debugger port
  ]
}
```

#### Global Default Port Mappings

Configure default port mappings that apply to all CodeForge tasks in your VSCode settings:

```json
{
  "codeforge.defaultPortMappings": [
    "8080:8080", // Web server
    "3000:3000", // Node.js development server
    "5432:5432", // PostgreSQL
    "6379:6379" // Redis
  ]
}
```

#### How Port Forwarding Works

1. **Automatic Detection**: When a CodeForge task runs, the extension automatically adds the specified port mappings to the Docker run command
2. **Task Priority**: Task-specific `ports` configuration overrides global `defaultPortMappings`
3. **Format**: Port mappings follow Docker's format: `"host_port:container_port"` or `"container_port"` (maps to same host port)
4. **Multiple Ports**: You can forward multiple ports by specifying an array of port mappings

#### Common Use Cases

- **Web Development**: Forward ports for development servers (3000, 8080, 4200)
- **Database Access**: Connect to databases running in containers (5432 for PostgreSQL, 3306 for MySQL)
- **Debugging**: Forward debugging ports for remote debugging (9229 for Node.js)
- **Microservices**: Forward multiple service ports for microservice architectures
